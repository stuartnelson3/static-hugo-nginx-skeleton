STATIC HUGO NGINX CONTAINER SKELETON

Skeleton for creating an alpine-linux based nginx container that will run your
static Hugo site (http://gohugo.io/).

Copy your Hugo-generated public/ folder here, and then make build.

Update the nginx.conf for whatever you need.

HTTP/2

key.pem and cert.pem were both generated using go:

% go run /usr/local/go/src/crypto/tls/generate_cert.go --host <host-name> --ca

Acquiring a real SSL Certificate is necessary.
